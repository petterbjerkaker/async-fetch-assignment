The first assignment contains asynchronous JavaScript and the Fetch API using the swapi (Star Wars API). 
As the assignment instructions says, there has been fetched data through the API for four different categories. Star Wars films, characters, planets, and species. 
The assignment contains vehicles as one of the categories, but I hope it is OK that species was chosen instead, as it was a more personal intriguing category.

Functionality of the index page:
User is met with four images and their respective headlines. By clicking an image, the user is redirected to a new page with information of the chose category. 
When user is redirected to new page, it is possible for the user to go back to the main page, by clicking the text "Return to home-page", located in the header.
